10-K into  which incorporated The registrant’s proxy statement for the 2010 annual meeting of  stockholders (the “Proxy Statement”)  Part III        PART I  ITEM 1     Business   Whirlpool Corporation, the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances, was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of Delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898  Whirlpool manufactures products in 12 countries under 13 principal brand names and markets products in nearly every country around the world  Whirlpool’s geographic segments consist of North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia  As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 67,000 employees   As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, “Whirlpool,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries   Products and Markets  Whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products, primarily for home use  Our principal products are laundry appliances, refrigerators, cooking appliances, dishwashers, mixers and other small household appliances  We also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems   For each class of products which accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years, the following table lists the total net sales of each class        Percent in  2009   Year ended December 31 (millions of dollars)  Class of Similar Products         2009          2008          2007     Home Laundry Appliances   31%  $ 5,345  $ 5,760  $ 5,678 Home

    In North America, Whirlpool markets and distributes major home appliances and portable appliances under a variety of brand names  In the United States, we market and distribute products primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air, Roper, Estate, Admiral, Magic Chef, Amana, and Inglis brand names primarily to retailers, distributors, and builders  In Canada, we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the Inglis, Admiral, Whirlpool, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Amana, Roper, Estate, and KitchenAid brand names  In Mexico, we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, Acros, KitchenAid, and Supermatic brand names  We sell some products to other manufacturers, distributors, and retailers for resale in North America under those manufacturers’ and retailers’ respective brand names  We have manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico   Whirlpool is a major supplier to Sears of laundry, refrigerator, dishwasher, and trash compactor home appliances  Sears markets some of the products that we supply to them under its Kenmore brand name  Sears is also a major outlet for our Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air, and Amana brand products  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 10%, 11% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales were attributable to sales to Sears  More information regarding Whirlpool’s relationship with Sears can be found under the caption “Forward-Looking Perspective” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” contained in the Financial Supplement to this Report   In Europe, we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, Amana, Bauknecht, Ignis, Laden, and Polar brand names, and major and portable appliances under the KitchenAid brand name  In addition to our extensive operations in Western Europe, we have sales subsidiaries in    2    Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Croatia, Morocco, and Turkey, with representative offices in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro  Whirlpool markets a full line of products under the Whirlpool, KIC, and Ignis brand names in South Africa   Whirlpool’s European operations also sell products carrying the Whirlpool, Bauknecht, and Ignis brand names to distributors and dealers in Africa and the Middle East  Whirlpool has manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, and Sweden   In Latin America, we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Brastemp, Consul, and Eslabon de Lujo brand names  We manage appliance sales and distribution in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru through our Brazilian subsidiary, and in Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay through our distributors  We manage appliance sales and distribution in Central American countries, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala, and Ecuador through our Brazilian subsidiary and through distributors  In Latin America, Whirlpool has manufacturing facilities in Brazil   In Asia, we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances into five operating groups:   China, which includes mainland China;   Hong Kong and Taiwan;   India, which includes Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan;   Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands; and   Southeast Asia, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, and Japan  We market and sell our products in Asia primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Amana, and Jenn-Air brand names by a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through full-service distributors to a large network of retail stores  In Asia, we have manufacturing facilities in China and India   Competition  Competition in the home appliance industry is intense  In addition to traditional competitors such as Electrolux, General Electric, and Kenmore, there are expanding foreign competitors such as LG, Bosch Siemens, Samsung and Haier  Moreover, the U S  customer base is characterized by large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services, and prices  In most major markets throughout the world, 2009 was a challenging year with continued high costs in the areas of metals and oil-based materials, such as resins  In addition, in 2008 and 2009 we experienced significant macroeconomic challenges including instability in the financial markets  These challenges have impacted the global economy, the capital markets and global demand for our products  Competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors, including cost, selling price, distribution, performance, innovation, product features, energy efficiency, quality, and other financial incentives  These financial incentives include cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, salesperson incentives, volume rebates, and terms  We believe that we can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity, improving quality, lowering costs, focusing on research and development including introducing new products through innovation, building strong brands, enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings, continuing to expand our global footprint, expanding trade distribution channels, and taking other efficiency-enhancing measures   Other Information  We are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business  In areas where a single supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment  Some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated  There has been continued cost pressure in some areas, such as metals and oil-based materials, during most of the year  In the later part of the year, costs in most of these areas started to show signs of relief, but remain at elevated levels  We believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules     3    The patents we presently own are considered, in the aggregate, to be valuable  Also, Whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the U S  and foreign countries  The most important trademarks that we own in North America are Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Estate, Roper, Admiral, Amana, Jenn-Air, and Acros  The most important trademarks that we own in Europe are Whirlpool, Bauknecht, and Ignis  In Latin America, the most important trademarks that we own are Whirlpool, Brastemp, and Consul  The most important trademark that we own in Asia is Whirlpool  We receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air, Admiral, Amana, and Magic Chef brand names   Expenditures for Whirlpool-sponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately $455 million in 2009, $436 million in 2008, and $421 million in 2007   Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management  Our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations  Where laws and regulations are less restrictive, we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility   We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal, state, local, and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations  Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position  Capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to approximately $29 million in 2009, $31 million in 2008 and $28 million in 2007  We estimate that in 2010, environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately $29 million  Capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2010   The entire major home appliance industry, including Whirlpool, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards  These standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration, energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances, regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions, and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives  Compliance with these various standards, as they become effective, will require some product redesign  However, we believe, based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations, that we will be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations   State and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “Superfund” sites in the United States  However, based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants, we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings, financial condition, or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters   For information about the challenges and risks associated with our foreign operations, see “Risks Relating to Our Business” under Item 1A below   For certain other financial information concerning our business segments and foreign and domestic operations, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Financial Supplement to this report     4    For information on our global restructuring plans, and the impact of these plans on our operating segments, see Notes 10 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Financial Supplement to this report   For information on product recalls, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Financial Supplement to this report   Maytag Acquisition  On March 31, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Maytag  The aggregate purchase price for Maytag was approximately $1 9 billion, including approximately $848 million of cash and approximately 9 7 million shares of Whirlpool common stock  Maytag had consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $4 9 billion  With the acquisition, Whirlpool added an array of home appliance brands including Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Magic Chef, and Admiral  We are realizing cost savings from all areas across the value chain including product manufacturing and marketing, global procurement, logistics, infrastructure and support areas, product research and development, and asset utilization  In 2007, we completed the sale of all Maytag adjacent businesses which were not part of the core appliance business   Executive Officers of the Registrant  The following table sets forth the names and ages of our executive officers on February 10, 2010, the positions and offices they held on that date, and the year they first became executive officers:    Name   Office     First Became an Executive  Officer   Age  Jeff M  Fettig   Director, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer   1994  52  Michael A  Todman   Director and President,

Whirlpool that are not historical facts and are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity  Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “believe,” “may impact,” “on track,” and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, a merger, or our businesses  In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements  Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict  Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:  Risks Relating to Our Business  Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products  A number of economic factors, including, but not limited to, gross domestic product, availability of consumer credit, interest rates, consumer confidence and debt levels, retail trends, housing starts, sales of existing homes, the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults, and foreign currency exchange rates, generally affect demand for our products  Higher unemployment rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, and higher tax rates adversely affect demand  The decline in economic activity and conditions in the United States and the other markets in which we operate has, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future   The global financial crisis could adversely affect our business and financial performance  The ongoing global financial crisis has tightened credit markets and lowered liquidity levels  Lower credit availability may increase borrowing costs  Some of our suppliers are experiencing serious financial problems due to reduced access to credit and lower revenues  Financial duress may prompt some of our suppliers to seek to renegotiate supply terms with us, reduce production or file for bankruptcy protection  Our customers may be unable to obtain financing to purchase products and meet their payment obligations to us  In addition, the financial crisis could result in the insolvency of one or more of our customers  The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our operations, earnings, cash flows and/or financial position   The loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers, which include Sears, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Casas Bahia, Best Buy, Ikea, major buying groups, and builders, could adversely affect our financial performance  We sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers  Most of our products are not sold through long-term contracts, which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers  As the trade customers continue to become larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means, including improved efficiency, lower pricing, and increased promotional programs  If we are unable to meet their requirements, our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected  The loss of, or substantial    6    decline in volume of, sales to Sears, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Casas Bahia, Best Buy, Ikea, major buying groups or builders, or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products, could adversely affect our financial performance  Additionally, if these trade customers lose market share, this loss could negatively impact our financial performance   We face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance  Each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors, many of which have strong consumer brand equity  Several of these competitors, such as Electrolux, LG, Samsung, Bosch Siemens and General Electric are large, well-established companies that rank among the Global Fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market  Competition in the global market is based on a number of factors including performance, innovation, product features and design, energy efficiency, quality, cost, selling price, distribution, and financial incentives, such as cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, sales person incentives, volume rebates, and terms  In the past, our competitors, especially global competitors with low-cost sources of supply outside the United States, have aggressively priced their products and/or introduced new products to increase market share  If we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment, our business and financial performance could be negatively affected   Foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance  We generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U S  dollar  Changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the U S  dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations  Recent extreme volatility in the foreign exchange markets has increased our risk  We use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures  We cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which may adversely affect our financial performance  In addition, because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U S  dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings   Product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance  We are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property  In the event that any of our products prove to be defective, we may need to recall and/or redesign such products  In addition, any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations  We do maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us  We may also be involved in certain class action litigation, for which no insurance is available  Product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all  In addition, we do not maintain any product recall insurance, so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows   We regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers  We are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues, and as necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances  Actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors, including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall, repair and administrative costs, whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by Whirlpool or the supplier, and, if initially borne by Whirlpool, whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier  The actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations   Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance  We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks, including litigation concerning product defects, intellectual property rights, taxes, environmental matters, commercial matters and compliance    7    with competition laws and sales and trading practices  Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention  We estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time  Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid  Actual results may significantly vary from our estimates   An inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance  The highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative  Our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs, drive productivity and quality improvements, and accelerate our rate of innovation  Our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits  In addition, our failure to provide high-quality, innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales  If we failed in this way, it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance  Additionally, our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes  Our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify, develop, manufacture, market, and sell new or improved products in these changing markets   We face inventory and other asset risk  We record a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value  We also review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  If we determine that impairment has occurred, we record a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value  Although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence, we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges  Such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results   Fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits  The primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel, oil, plastic resins, and base metals, such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel  On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances  Material cost inflation is expected to be approximately $200 to $300 million in 2010, largely driven by increases in base metals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc and nickel, as well as component parts and steel  Continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits   The ability of suppliers to deliver parts, components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities, including our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our global business performance  We use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components  Because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risks  In addition, certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers  We would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results  Our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are    8    subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, work stoppages, fire, earthquake, flooding, or other natural disasters  Such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products  Any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance   Significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs, and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes, could adversely affect our financial results  We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our North American employees and certain foreign employees  We also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Pension Protection Act and the Internal Revenue Code govern the funding obligations for our U S  pension plans, which are our principal pension plans  Our U S  defined benefit plans were frozen as of December 31, 2006 for substantially all participants  For 2007 and beyond, Whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan   As of December 31, 2009, our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately $2,329 million ($1,568 million of which was attributable to pension plans and $761 million of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits)  Estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions  These assumptions include discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates  These assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond market returns, and health care cost trend rates  Significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses   Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands  We consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business  We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements  Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our processes may diminish our competitiveness   We have applied for patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes  We cannot be assured that the U S  Patent and Trademark Office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications  Additionally, the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated, or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage  Further, the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as United States law  As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance   Moreover, while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology, brands, products, or services  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products   We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security, which may materially adversely affect our operations, financial condition and operating results  We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface    9    with our customers, as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency  Information technology system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers, impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products, other business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach   In addition, we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions, such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration, to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies  If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers  Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or harm employee morale   Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets   Risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs  For the year ended December 31, 2009, we derived approximately 45% of our net sales from outside of North America (which includes Canada and Mexico), including 22% in Latin America, 19% in Europe and 4% in Asia  We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future  Accordingly, we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance  These risks include the following:     •  changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;     •  various import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;     •  imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;     •  political, legal, and economic instability;     •  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;      •  changes in foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial  interpretations of tax laws;     •  inflation;     •  work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;     •  government price controls;     •  extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable; and     •  the inability to repatriate cash   Additionally, as a U S  corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations  Additionally, any determination that we have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on us   Terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, natural disasters, and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chain, and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products  Such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, both in the United States and elsewhere   We are subject to, and could be further subject to, governmental investigations or actions by other third parties  We are subject to various federal, foreign and state laws, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions  Government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating    10    alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry, including our compressor business headquartered in Brazil  These investigations, as well as additional investigations by other governmental agencies, could result in civil or criminal charges against Whirlpool and its employees, and the imposition of fines and penalties  In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous related class action lawsuits in various jurisdictions, which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors, and additional lawsuits may be filed  The impact of these investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations   A deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business  As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 67,000 employees  Of those employees, various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 60%  Our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms  Due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements, we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees  We may be subject to employee work stoppages that, if such events were to occur, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations  Further, we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms, or at all, which may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations   Our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  We depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives, senior management and skilled personnel, particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry  We cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us  A lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart Whirlpool  An inability to hire, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by, for example, delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations   Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation  The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, advertising, safety, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate  These laws and regulations may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events  Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities  In addition, we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations, especially relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  These types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance  Additionally, we could be subjected to future liabilities, fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations, including environmental regulations  Cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us   ITEM 1B     Unresolved Staff Comments   None   ITEM 2     Properties   Our principal executive offices are located in Benton Harbor, Michigan  On December 31, 2009, our principal manufacturing operations were carried on at 37 locations worldwide, 26 of which are located in 11 countries outside the United States, primarily in the Europe region, and to a lesser extent in Asia, Latin America, and Mexico  Whirlpool occupied a total of approximately 65 2 million square feet devoted to manufacturing,    11    service, sales and administrative offices, warehouse and distribution space  Over 33 8 million square feet of such space is occupied under lease  In general, all facilities are well maintained, suitably equipped, and in good operating condition   ITEM 3     Legal Proceedings   Information with respect to legal proceedings can be found under the heading “Legal Contingencies” in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial

$17 billion and net earnings available to Whirlpool common stockholders of $328 million for the year ended December 31, 2009  We are a leading producer of major home appliances in North America and Latin America and have a significant presence in markets throughout Europe and India  We have received worldwide recognition for accomplishments in a variety of business and social efforts, including leadership, diversity, innovative product design, business ethics, social responsibility and community involvement  We conduct our business through four reportable segments, which we define based on geography  Our reportable segments consist of North America (55% of revenue), Europe (19% of revenue), Latin America (22% of revenue), and Asia (4% of revenue)   Our global branded consumer products strategy is to introduce innovative new products, increase brand customer loyalty, expand our presence in foreign markets, enhance our trade management platform, improve total cost and quality by expanding and leveraging our global operating platform and where appropriate, make strategic acquisitions and investments   We monitor country-specific economic factors such as gross domestic product, consumer confidence, retail trends, housing starts and completions, sales of existing homes and mortgage interest rates as key indicators of industry demand  In addition to profitability, we also focus on country, brand, product and channel sales when assessing and forecasting financial results   During 2008 and 2009, we experienced significant macroeconomic challenges including instability in the financial markets  These challenges have impacted the global economy, the capital markets and global demand for our products  Although we have made significant progress in reducing cost in 2009 to better align with global demand, and in improving our liquidity position, we expect that we will continue to experience the effects of liquidity strain on our suppliers, continued low consumer confidence and consumer discretionary spending   Competition in the home appliance industry is intense in all global markets we serve  In addition to our traditional competitors such as Electrolux, General Electric, and Kenmore in North America, there has been an emergence of strong global competitors such as LG, Bosch Siemens, Samsung and Haier  In each geographic region, our customer base is consolidated and characterized by large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices  We believe that our productivity and cost controls, new innovative product introductions, and improved product price/mix will enhance our ability to respond to these competitive conditions   FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  During the March 2009 quarter, we changed our method of depreciation prospectively for substantially all long-lived production machinery and equipment to a modified units of production depreciation method  Under this method, we record depreciation based on units produced, unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method  Prior to 2009, all machinery and equipment was depreciated using the straight-line method  We believe depreciating machinery and equipment based on units of production is a preferable method as it best matches the usage of assets with the revenues    F-2    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    derived from those assets  As a result of this change and our overall lower levels of production in 2009, our depreciation expense by operating segment decreased for 2009 as follows: North America—$46 million, Europe—$25 million, Latin America—$11 million and Asia—$1 million, for a total of $83 million  Net of amounts capitalized into ending inventories, gross margin increased for 2009 as follows: North America—$41 million, Europe—$19 million, Latin America—$11 million and Asia—$1 million, for a total of $72 million   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the year ended December 31, 2009, consolidated net sales were $17 billion  Consolidated net earnings available to Whirlpool common stockholders were $328 million, or $4 34 per diluted share, decreasing from $418 million or $5 50 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008  The decrease in net sales and earnings reflects lower appliance industry demand resulting primarily from weaker economies within our North America and Europe regions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency   Consolidated Net Sales  The table below summarizes by region consolidated net sales and units sold:    Millions of dollars       2009          Change          2008          Change          2007

currency, consolidated net sales decreased 5 8% compared to 2008  Consolidated net sales for 2008 decreased 2 6% compared to 2007 primarily due to lower unit shipments, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales decreased 5 1% compared to 2007   Significant regional trends were as follows:       •  North America net sales decreased in 2009 by 11 0% compared to 2008 primarily due to a 9 5% decrease in units sold  The decline in units sold is due to decreased industry demand resulting from continued weak economies in the U S , Mexico and Canada in 2009  Additionally, net sales was negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was partially offset by improved product price/mix  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, North America net sales decreased 9 4% in 2009  North    F-3    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)        America net sales decreased in 2008 by 8 1% compared to 2007 primarily due to a 10 4% decrease in units sold  The decline in units sold is primarily due to decreased industry demand resulting from a weak U S  economy in 2008  Partially offsetting the decrease in units sold was better product price/mix and higher market share in 2008 compared to 2007  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, North America net sales decreased 8 2% in 2008         •  Europe net sales decreased in 2009 by 16 9% compared to 2008, primarily due to an 11 7% decrease in units sold due to lower appliance industry demand and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Europe net sales decreased 11 2% in 2009  Net sales increased in 2008 by 4 4% compared to 2007, primarily due to favorable foreign currency and better product price/mix, partially offset by a decrease in unit volume due to lower market demand in the second half of the year  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Europe net sales decreased 3 1% in 2008         •  Latin America net sales were consistent in 2009 compared to 2008 as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower BEFIEX credits recognized were fully offset by a 14 5% increase in units sold  The increase in units sold was a result of favorable economic conditions and the Impostos sobre Produtos (“IPI”) sales tax holiday in Brazil  The IPI sales tax holiday was the primary driver of the reduction of BEFIEX credits monetized  This sales tax holiday was declared by the Brazilian government on certain appliances in our Latin America region beginning in the second quarter and extended through the remainder of 2009  During this holiday, we monetized reduced amounts of BEFIEX credits because our BEFIEX credits are monetized through the offset of IPI taxes due  The IPI sales tax holiday expired January 31, 2010  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Latin America net sales increased 7 1% in 2009  Net sales increased 7 8% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in volume of 5 7% and the favorable impact of foreign currency  The increase in volume was due to continued growth in the appliance industry, increased market share and favorable economic conditions throughout the region  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Latin America net sales increased 1 7% in 2008   During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we monetized $69 million, $168 million and $131 million of BEFIEX credits, respectively  We expect to continue recognizing credits as they are monetized  As of December 31, 2009, $693 million of these export credits remain  Future actions by the Brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits         •  Asia net sales increased 10 3% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 20 8% increase in units sold offset partially by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Asia net sales increased 18 4% in 2009  Net sales increased 6 5% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 5 7% increase in units sold  The increase in volume was due to continued growth in the appliance industry, primarily in India  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Asia net sales increased 9 7% in 2008   Gross Margin  The consolidated gross margin percentage increased compared to 2008 due primarily to cost reduction initiatives and productivity improvements, partially offset by foreign currency and lower regional tax incentives associated with BEFIEX   The table below summarizes gross margin percentages by region:           2009          Change          2008          Change          2007      North America   12 9%  2 9pts

14 9      F-4    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    Significant regional trends were as follows:        •  North America gross margin increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to continued cost reductions and improved productivity, product price/mix and a postretirement curtailment gain associated with the suspension of annual credits to retiree health savings accounts totaling $80 million  Additionally, gross margin was positively impacted by a $41 million reduction in LIFO reserves resulting from cost deflation  These gross margin improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of lower volumes, foreign currency and $35 million in charges associated with a product recall  Gross margin decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher material and oil-related costs, lower industry demand and lower productivity  Additionally, gross margin was positively impacted by certain asset sale gains totaling $31 million and postretirement curtailments totaling $15 million, which were more than offset by $42 million in higher reserves for LIFO resulting from cost inflation and a $32 million charge related to product recall  These decreases were partially offset by improved product price/mix  See Notes 4, 6 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to LIFO, product recalls and the postretirement curtailment gains, respectively         •  Europe gross margin decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, asset sale gains and insurance proceeds totaling $14 million recognized in 2008  These decreases were partially offset by cost reductions and productivity initiatives and lower material and oil-related costs  Gross margin decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to lower productivity and industry demand, which were partially offset by improved product price/mix  Also contributing to lower gross margin were gains from asset sales of $9 million compared with $47 million recognized in 2007  Lower gains in 2008 associated with asset sales were partially offset by gains of $5 million from insurance proceeds         •  Latin America gross margin decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to a reduction in regional tax incentives associated with BEFIEX, higher material and oil-related costs, lower price/mix and an operating tax settlement, offset by improved productivity and certain credits in the amount of $11 million related to refundable energy surcharges  See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the foreign operating tax settlement  Gross margin increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to improvements in product price/mix, productivity and regional tax incentives associated primarily with BEFIEX, which combined to more than offset higher material and oil-related costs         •  Asia gross margin increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to continued cost reductions and improved productivity and a $3 million asset sale gain, which were partially offset by lower product price/mix  Gross margin increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to improvements in product price/mix, productivity, inventory transition costs and volume, which more than offset higher material and oil-related costs   Selling, General and Administrative  The table below summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by region:    Millions of dollars   2009    As a % of Sales  2008     As a % of Sales  2007     As a % of Sales   North America   $ 653  6 8%  $ 851  7 9%  $ 791  6 7%  Europe    362  10 8    414  10 3

9 5%  $1,736  8 9%           F-5    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    In 2009, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of consolidated net sales, decreased compared to  the prior year, primarily as a result of infrastructure cost reductions and lower brand investments  In 2008, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of consolidated net sales, increased compared to 2007, primarily due to lower sales volume and higher brand investment, partially offset by lower infrastructure costs and $20 million in gains associated with asset sales  Additionally, this increase was impacted by a $12 million operating tax credit recorded by our Latin America region during 2007   Restructuring  Restructuring initiatives resulted in charges of $126 million, $149 million and $61 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, reflecting ongoing efforts to optimize our global operating platform  These charges are included in restructuring in our Consolidated Statements of Income and primarily consist of charges to restructure the cooking platform in Latin America, shift refrigeration and dishwasher capacity within Europe and North America, shift cooking capacity within North America, restructure the laundry platforms in North America, Europe and Asia and reorganize the salaried workforce throughout North America and Europe   On October 27, 2008, management committed to a workforce reduction plan to reduce our employee base worldwide between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the beginning of 2010   On August 28, 2009, we announced changes to our North American manufacturing operations which will result in the closure of our manufacturing facility in Evansville, Indiana in mid-2010  We currently expect that approximately 1,100 full-time positions will be eliminated as a result of the closure   For additional information about restructuring and the impact by operating segment, see Note 10 and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Interest and Sundry Income (Expense)  Interest and sundry expense for 2009 increased by $75 million from $100 million in 2008 to $175 million in 2009  The increase in expense in 2009 was primarily due to charges incurred for legal contingencies and legal defense, partially offset by the favorable impacts of foreign currency  Interest and sundry expense for 2008 increased by $37 million from $63 million in 2007 to $100 million in 2008  Higher expense in 2008 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency and an impairment charge of $9 million in our Europe segment associated with an available for sale investment, partially offset by higher interest income  For additional information about litigation matters, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Interest Expense  Interest expense increased for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the combination of higher interest rates and higher average debt levels, offset partially by a reduction in accrued interest of $18 million as a result of entering into a special program in Brazil to settle tax liabilities  Interest expense in 2008 was consistent with 2007 as higher debt levels were offset by lower interest rates   Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 20 6% in 2009 and 81 7% in 2008 and an expense of 14 5% in 2007  The reduction in tax benefit from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in profitability, changes in dispersion of global income and the unfavorable impact of audits and settlements  The reduction in tax expense in 2007 to a benefit in 2008 is primarily due to a decline in profitability, energy tax credits generated in the U S  in 2008 from the production of certain eligible energy efficient appliances, as well as a combination of certain    F-6    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    discrete items recognized during the year, dispersion of global income, tax credit availability, and tax planning activities  For additional information about our consolidated tax provision, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Earnings from Continuing Operations  Earnings from continuing operations were $354 million in 2009 compared to $447 million and $669 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to the factors described above     Millions of dollars, except per share data           2009                  2008                  2007         Earnings from continuing operations   $ 354  $ 447  $ 669 Diluted net earnings from continuing operations per  share    4 68   5 88   8 37  Net Earnings Available to Whirlpool Common Stockholders  Net earnings available to Whirlpool common stockholders were $328 million in 2009 compared to $418 million and $640 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to the factors described above  Earnings were impacted by $7 million in losses from discontinued operations for 2007     Millions of dollars, except per share data           2009                  2008                  2007         Net earnings available to Whirlpool common  stockholders   $ 328  $ 418  $ 640 Diluted net earnings per share available to Whirlpool  common stockholders    4 34   5 50   8 01  FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE  For the year ended December 31, 2010, we currently estimate earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $6 50 to $7 00, and free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $400 to $500 million  Within North America we expect demand to increase 2-4% and within Europe we expect demand to remain flat  Within Latin America and Asia we expect demand to increase 5-10% and 3-5%, respectively  Material cost inflation is expected to increase by approximately $200 to $300 million, largely driven by increases in component parts, steel and base metals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc and nickel  We expect to offset these higher costs with productivity improvements, new product introductions, improved product price/mix and administrative and infrastructure cost reductions  Our innovation product pipeline continues to grow and drive higher average sales values  In addition, consumer and trade response to our new product offerings has been positive, and we continue to accelerate our global branded consumer products strategy of delivering relevant innovation to markets worldwide   The table below reconciles projected 2010 cash provided by operations determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure  Management believes that free cash flow provides shareholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations  There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations  We define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations after capital expenditures and proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses     F-7    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    The projections shown here are based upon many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made  by management and the board of directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies     Millions of dollars   2010 Outlook   Cash provided by operating activities   $ 925   –    $1,025   Capital expenditures    (525)  –     (575)  Proceeds from sale of assets/businesses    —   –     50        Free cash flow   $ 400   –    $ 500         Agreements with trade customers  We enter into agreements with our trade customers in the ordinary course of business  Most of our products are not sold through long-term agreements  Most trade customers have the ability to change volume among suppliers   We regularly negotiate with major trade customers and manufacturers regarding supply arrangements for future periods beyond the current year  Sears is a major trade customer for both our OEM and Whirlpool branded products, which accounted for approximately 10%, 11% and 12% of our consolidated net sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively  The products and volumes we supply and the revenues we obtain may be significantly different in the future than those which currently exist  Based on current supply arrangements, we anticipate maintaining a significant, but reduced, level of OEM volume beginning in 2010  In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset the decline through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network  We expect to continue to grow our own brand sales, supported by significant innovation, through our full distribution trade network and execution of our brand-focused value creation strategy   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt  By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk  We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business  The volume and timing of refrigeration and air conditioning production impacts our cash flows and consists of increased production in the first half of the year to meet increased demand in the summer months   The funding markets have been volatile during the majority of 2008 and 2009 and we have experienced negative global economic trends  To succeed in this environment we have aggressively taken steps to further reduce all areas of cost, production capacity and working capital  As a result of the global volatility and challenging economic trends, we decided to exit the commercial paper market during the December 2008 quarter and initiated borrowing under our committed bank line of credit (“Credit Agreement”), provided by a syndicate of highly-rated banks  Outside the U S , short-term funding is provided by bank borrowings on uncommitted lines of credit   On February 27, 2009, we entered into an Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to assure flexibility in future credit availability  The First Amendment increased the spread over LIBOR to 3%, the spread over prime to 2% and the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed $1 1 billion, to 1% and replaced the facility fee with an unused commitment fee of 0 50%     F-8    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    On August 13, 2009, we entered into a second Amendment to our Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to further assure  flexibility in future credit availability  The Second Amendment divides and reduces the existing $2 2 billion credit facility into a $1 35 billion tranche maturing on August 13, 2012 (the “Extending Tranche”) and a $522 million tranche maturing December 1, 2010 (the “Non-Extending Tranche”)  For the Extending Tranche, the Second Amendment provides a utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed 50% of the facility, of 0 50%, and for the Non-Extending Tranche, the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed 50% of the facility, is 1%  The interest margin over LIBOR charged will be based on Whirlpool’s credit rating   As of December 31, 2009, there was no balance outstanding under our credit facility   On May 4, 2009, we completed a debt offering comprised of   $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8 000% Notes due 2012 and   $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8 600% Notes due 2014  The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes   For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   We believe that our operating cash flow, together with access to sufficient sources of liquidity, will be adequate to meet our ongoing funding requirements  We are in compliance with financial covenants in our credit facility for all periods presented   Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans  Defined Benefit Plans  On August 28, 2009, we announced the closure of our manufacturing facility in Evansville, Indiana in mid-2010  The announcement triggered a curtailment in our pension plan for Evansville hourly employees, resulting in a one-time curtailment loss of $6 6 million included in net periodic cost with an offset to other comprehensive income, net of tax  During 2009, we recorded the entire loss in our Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of cost of products sold  The closure of the Evansville facility also triggered a curtailment in our U S  retiree healthcare plan, resulting in a curtailment gain  The curtailment gain will be recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of cost of products sold as the employees terminate, which is expected to occur in 2010   On June 16, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the option for the company to use up to $100 million of company stock to fund the U S  pension plans  If we elect to partially fund the U S  pension plans in company stock, contributions may be made on a periodic basis from treasury stock, or, with the prior approval of the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, from authorized, but unissued shares  As of December 31, 2009, we have not used company stock to fund our U S  pension plans   On February 9, 2009, we announced the indefinite suspension of the annual credit to retirement health savings accounts for the majority of active participants  The result of the suspension was a curtailment gain of $89 million   On August 1, 2008, we amended certain retiree medical benefits associated with our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility to be consistent with those benefits provided by the Whirlpool Corporation Group Benefit Plan  This amendment resulted in a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation of $229 million with a corresponding increase to other comprehensive income, net of tax, within equity of our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009     F-9    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    401(k) Defined Contribution Plan  During the March 2009 quarter we announced an indefinite suspension of company matching contributions to our 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all U S  employees  We also announced that our automatic company contributions equal to 3% of employees’ eligible pay will be contributed in company stock  During the December 2009 quarter we announced the reinstatement of company matching contributions to our 401(k) defined contribution plan, covering substantially all U S  employees, effective March 2010   For additional information about pension and postretirement benefit plans see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Share Repurchase Program  In June 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million  During 2007, we repurchased 3 8 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $368 million and during the three months ended March 31, 2008, we repurchased 1 1 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $97 million under this program  At March 31, 2008, there were no remaining funds authorized under this program   On April 23, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million  Share repurchases are made from time to time on the open market as conditions warrant  During 2008, we repurchased 1 9 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $150 million under this program  There were no repurchases during 2009  At December 31, 2009, there were $350 million of remaining funds authorized under this program   Sources and Uses of Cash  We expect to meet our cash needs for 2010 from cash flows from continuing operations, cash and equivalents and financing arrangements  Our cash and equivalents were $1 4 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $146 million at December 31, 2008   Cash Flows from Operating Activities of Continuing Operations  Cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2009 was $1,550 million, an increase of $1,223 million compared to 2008  Cash provided by continuing operations reflects lower payments for inventory, lower cash payments for accounts payable and other operating accruals and lower employee compensation payments, partially offset by lower collections of accounts receivable  Cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2008 was $327 million, a decrease of $600 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007  Cash provided by continuing operations for 2008 reflects lower cash earnings primarily from our North America and Europe segments compared to 2007  Cash provided by continuing operations also reflects lower accounts payable due to adjusting volume based on demand and higher pension contributions  The above decreases in cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and lower restructuring spending   Cash Flows from Investing Activities of Continuing Operations  Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was an outflow of $499 million in 2009 compared to an outflow of $433 million last year  The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2009 and higher investments primarily associated with business acquisition activity in our international locations  Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2008 was an outflow of $433 million compared to an outflow of $331 million during 2007  The increase in cash    F-10    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    used in investing activities was primarily due to 2007 receipt of proceeds from the sale of certain Maytag discontinued businesses of $100 million, lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008, and higher capital spending   The goal of our global operating platform is to enhance our competitive position in the global home appliance industry by reducing costs, driving productivity and quality improvements, and accelerating our rate of innovation  We plan to continue our comprehensive worldwide effort to optimize our regional manufacturing facilities, supply base, product platforms and technology resources to better support our global products, brands and customers  We intend to make additional investments to improve our competitiveness in 2010  Capital spending is expected to be between $525 and $575 million in 2010 in support of our investment in innovative product technologies and our global operating platform initiatives   Cash Flows from Financing Activities of Continuing Operations  Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for 2009 compared to 2008 was an inflow of $144 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an inflow of $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2008  The current year reflects proceeds received related to two debt offerings totaling $850 million while the prior year reflects proceeds received related to the issuance of $500 million of 5 5% notes due March 1, 2013  For additional information about our $850 million debt offerings, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  The current year also reflects net repayments of short-term borrowings and long-term debt repayments totaling $572 million compared to net repayments of $30 million in 2008  During 2009, we paid dividends to common stockholders totaling $128 million, paid debt financing fees of $38 million and received proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises of $21 million  During 2008, we repurchased stock totaling $247 million, paid dividends to common stockholders totaling $128 million and received proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises of $21 million   Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for 2008 compared to 2007 was an inflow of $141 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to an outflow of $696 million for the year ended December 31, 2007  The year ended December 31, 2008 reflects proceeds received related to the issuance of $500 million of 5 5% notes due March 1, 2013 and the repayment of $125 million of 9 1% debentures  Net proceeds of short-term borrowings were $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to net repayments of $243 million in 2007  During 2008, we repurchased stock totaling $247 million, paid dividends to common stockholders totaling $128 million and received proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises of $21 million  During 2007, we repurchased stock totaling $368 million, paid dividends to common stockholders totaling $134 million and received proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises of $68 million   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Whirlpool has guarantee arrangements in place in a Brazilian subsidiary  As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks, supporting purchases from Whirlpool, following its normal credit policies  If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, the subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank, and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, these amounts totaled $300 million and $203 million, respectively  Our only recourse related to these agreements is legal or administrative collection efforts directed against the customer     F-11    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS  The following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and

the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements         Purchase obligations include our “take-or-pay” contracts with materials vendors and minimum payment obligations to other suppliers        Other long-term liabilities include our expected 2010 U S  pension and foreign pension fund contributions in the amount of $41 million  Required contributions for future years depend on certain factors that cannot be determined at this time         The table does not include short-term credit facility borrowings  For additional information about short-term borrowings, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements         Not included in the above table are tax payments associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to estimate the period of payment   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U S  (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions  We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates     F-12                 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment  The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions  Those assumptions include, among other assumptions, the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates  These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively  As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods  While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and related future expense  Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2010 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2009  The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2009 retirement obligations and 2010 retirement benefit costs of our U S  plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:    Millions of dollars Change in assumption    Estimated increase (decrease) in 2010  pension cost     Estimated increase (decrease) in  Projected Benefit Obligation for the

appropriate to use for other years’ financial results  Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results  For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Income Taxes  We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with GAAP guidance  These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets  We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, are expected to be realizable in future years  Realization of our net operating loss and tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and considers projections of future profitability  We provide a valuation    F-13    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable  If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made  Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will increase income in the period such determination is made   As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total deferred tax assets of $2,275 million and $2,212 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $180 million and $147 million, respectively  Our effective tax rate has ranged from (81 7)% to 33 9% over the past five years and has been influenced by tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income  A 1 0% increase in our effective tax rate would have decreased 2009 earnings by approximately $3 million  Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including enacted laws, tax planning strategies, business profitability and the expiration of energy tax credit legislation at the end of 2010   In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve  For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   BEFIEX Credits  Our Brazilian operations earned tax credits under the Brazilian government’s export incentive program  These credits reduce Brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales, resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales  Based on a recalculation of available credits and a favorable court decision in the December 2005 quarter, we were able to recognize approximately $69 million, $168 million and $131 million of export credits during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively  As of December 31, 2009, approximately $693 million of export credits remain  We recognize credits as they are monetized; however, future actions by the Brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits  BEFIEX credits are not subject to income taxes   Product Recalls  The establishment of a liability for product recalls is periodically required and is impacted by several factors such as customer response rate, consumer options, field repair costs, inventory repair costs, extended warranty costs, communication structure and other miscellaneous costs such as legal, logistics and consulting  The customer response rate, which represents an estimate of the total number of units to be serviced as a percentage of the total number of units affected by the recall, is the most significant factor in estimating the total cost of each recall  To determine a response rate, we consider the population of the affected appliances based on evaluating the design issue or defective part in the appliance and the respective years in which it was included in manufacturing the appliance to determine the affected population  We also consider the type and age of the affected appliance to determine the affected population and apply historical response rates based on current and past experience factors to derive an estimated liability which is revised, as necessary, depending on our actual response rate  Differences between our assumptions and actual experience could have a material impact on our product recall reserves  For additional information about product recalls, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Warranty Obligations  The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized  The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and reflects our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold  Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated    F-14    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    warranty claims as new information becomes available  Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations  New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available  For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   Goodwill and Intangible Valuations  We sell products under a number of trademarks, many of which we developed  Trademark development costs are expensed as incurred  We also purchase trademark assets and goodwill in acquisitions  Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademark assets, based on estimated fair value, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill  Trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized  We have two reporting units where goodwill is recorded which include North America and Embraco in our Latin America region  There have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units  We have trademark assets in our North America and Europe regions  Forecasted financial statements utilized in the valuation of our reporting units and forecasted revenue amounts utilized in determining the fair values of our trademarks are based upon Whirlpool’s current long range plans which are consistent with commercially available industry expectations  We test indefinite lived intangibles for impairment as of November 30 each year and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist   Goodwill Valuations  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level  The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded  In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets)  The difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill   We determine fair value based primarily on a discounted cash flow model which is an accepted valuation technique  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows from our reporting units   Significant Assumptions in evaluating Goodwill  In assessing goodwill for impairment for the North America reporting unit, significant assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model as of November 30, 2009 included revenue growth rates, a long term growth rate and the discount rate        •  Revenue growth rates used in the discounted cash flows model were based upon our long range plan for the next three years and range from -12% to 6%  Subsequent to this three year period, we applied expected growth rates to revenues which were consistent with commercially available industry market value and volume forecasts  The long term growth rate used was 2% based upon the compound average growth rate for the U S  T-7 appliance industry (T-7 refers to the following appliance categories: washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, ranges and compactors) over a 25 year period, and was also consistent with commercially available industry market value and volume forecasts     F-15    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)        •  The discount rate of 11% used in our discounted cash flow model, as of the November 30, 2009 assessment, was developed using the capital asset pricing model through which a weighted average cost of capital was derived  The discount rate was estimated using the risk free rate, market risk premium, and cost of debt prevalent as of the valuation date  The Beta and capital structure were estimated based on an analysis of comparable guideline companies  In addition, a risk premium was included to account for the risks inherent in the cash flows and to reconcile the fair value indicated by the discounted cash flow model to Whirlpool’s public market equity value at November 30, 2009   Other Considerations in evaluating Goodwill  Additionally, in assessing goodwill impairment for the North America reporting unit, we considered the implied control premium and concluded the implied control premium was reasonable based on other recent market transactions   The estimated fair value of our North America reporting unit has historically exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount  As of our November 30, 2009 valuation, the estimated fair value of our North America reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 25%   Our methodology for evaluating goodwill for impairment has not changed since our impairment test performed as of November 30, 2008  We have updated our revenue projections discussed above based on our current long range plan, and current industry and economic conditions  The long term growth rate for the North America reporting unit has not changed from the rate that was used in our last annual impairment test   These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report   Intangible Valuations  In assessing the fair value of trademarks, we utilize a relief from royalty method  If the carrying amount of a trademark exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate key assumptions involved in valuing our trademarks, including projected revenues, royalty rates and applicable discount rates   In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used the industry average weighted average cost of capital as the base adjusted for the higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets  The premium added considered that we have reduced the projected revenue from the forecasts used in previous years due in part to lower industry demand driven by the current economic conditions in our respective markets  Based on this analysis, we determined discount rates ranging from 11 0% to 11 5% (11 0% to 11 5% in 2008)   In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the intrinsic royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademarks  The most significant factors in determining the intrinsic royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademark and trade name intangibles, and the position of the trademarked products in a given market segment  Based on this analysis, we determined royalty rates ranging from 2 0% to 5 0% (0 5% to 5 0% in 2008)   Based on the compound annual growth rate of the U S  T-7 appliance industry over the past 25 years of 2%, and the strength of our trademarks in the marketplace, any reasonably likely change in the projected revenues or discount rate utilized in the valuation of our trademarks would not result in a material impairment charge     F-16    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    For additional information about goodwill and intangible valuations, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial  Statements   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No  168, “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”)  ASC 105 establishes the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U S  GAAP  The standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on September 30, 2009, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 810, “Consolidation”, regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities (formerly SFAS No  167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No  46 ”)  ASC 810 is intended to improve financial reporting by providing additional guidance to companies involved with variable interest entities and by requiring additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities  This standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after November 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing” (formerly SFAS No  166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets”)  ASC 860 requires more information about transfers of financial assets and where companies have continuing exposure to the risk related to transferred financial assets  It eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosure  This standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after November 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (formerly FASB Staff Position 107-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”)  ASC 825 requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies, as well as in annual financial statements  This standard also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of ASC 825 on June 30, 2009  See Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the fair value of our financial instruments   In March 2008, the FASB issued the disclosure requirements within ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (formerly SFAS No  161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB No  133”)  ASC 815 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows  The disclosure requirements apply to all derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815  The standard also applies to non-derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying under ASC 815  We adopted the disclosure requirements of ASC 815 on January 1, 2009  For additional information regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   In December 2007, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (formerly SFAS No  141 , “Business Combinations”)  ASC 805 requires us to continue to follow the guidance in SFAS 141 for certain aspects of business combinations, with additional guidance provided    F-17    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    defining the acquirer, the accounting for transaction costs and contingent consideration, recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, assets and liabilities arising from contingencies, defining a bargain purchase and recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase  In addition, adjustments associated with changes in tax contingencies that occur after the measurement period, not to exceed one year, are recorded as adjustments to income  This statement was effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008; however, the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of income tax contingencies is retrospective to business combinations completed prior to January 1, 2009  We adopted ASC 805 on January 1, 2009   In December 2007, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 810, “Consolidation”, regarding noncontrolling interests (formerly SFAS No  160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”)  ASC 810-10-65 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary  It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements  We adopted ASC 810-10-65 on January 1, 2009  As a result, we have reclassified financial statement line items within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income for the prior period to conform with this standard  Additionally, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure reflecting the impact of ASC 810-10-65 on our reconciliation of comprehensive income and stockholders’ equity   MARKET RISK  We have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise, strategic, financial, operation and compliance and reporting risk  The enterprise risk management process receives Board of Directors and Management oversight, drives risk mitigation decision-making and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle   We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and commodity prices, which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition  We manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments  Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes  Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments   We use foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted cross-border payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities  Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  At December 31, 2009, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of approximately $168 million, while a 10% favorable shift would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately $168 million  Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the re-measurement of the underlying exposures   We enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases that are not fixed directly through supply contracts  As of December 31, 2009, a 10% favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental $50 million gain or a $50 million loss related to these contracts     F-18    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    In January 2009, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings lowered our senior unsecured debt rating from “BBB” to “BBB-” and our  short-term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings from “A-2” to “A-3” and “F-2” to “F-3”, respectively, based on weakened operating performance and the pullback in discretionary consumer spending  Also in January 2009, Moody’s Investor Services lowered our senior unsecured rating from “Baa2” to “Baa3” and our commercial paper ratings from “Prime-2” to “Prime-3” based on weakening appliance industry demand  These rating adjustments may result in higher interest costs if we were to seek additional financing in the capital markets  See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing arrangements   OTHER MATTERS  Government authorities in various jurisdictions are conducting antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry, including our compressor business headquartered in Brazil (“Embraco”)  In 2009, Embraco sales represented approximately 7% of our global net sales   In February 2009, competition authorities in Brazil, the U S  and Europe began to seek documents from us in connection with their investigations  A grand jury subpoena from the U S  Department of Justice requested documents for the time period from 2003 to 2009  Competition authorities in other jurisdictions have sought similar information   In September 2009, the Brazilian competition commission (CADE) agreed to terminate the administrative investigation of our compressor business  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Whirlpool affiliates and certain executives located in Brazil acknowledged a violation of Brazilian antitrust law in the Brazilian compressor market by some Embraco employees  The settlement agreement provides for the affiliates to make contributions totaling 100 million Brazilian reais to a Brazilian government fund  The contributions translate to approximately $56 million, all of which was recorded as an expense in 2009  In December 2009, a Brazilian court agreed to the public prosecutor’s request to suspend a related criminal proceeding as to certain employees, including Paulo Periquito, former President, Whirlpool International  The proceeding will be dismissed after three years provided that the individuals comply with certain conditions imposed by the court, such as payment to a government fund, a charitable donation and periodic reporting to authorities  Suspension and dismissal of the proceeding does not involve any admission or finding of wrongdoing  We are cooperating with the ongoing government investigations in other jurisdictions and have taken actions, and will continue to take actions, to minimize our potential exposure   Since the government investigations became public in February 2009, we have been named as a defendant in numerous related antitrust lawsuits in various jurisdictions seeking damages in connection with the pricing of compressors from 1996 to 2009  Several other compressor manufacturers who are the subject of the government investigations have also been named as defendants in the litigation  United States federal lawsuits instituted on behalf of purported purchasers and containing class action allegations have been combined in one proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan  We intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously   The final outcome and impact of these matters, and related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables, and cannot be predicted with certainty  An accrual has been established only where we have determined that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  As of December 31, 2009, we have accrued charges of approximately $82 million related to these matters  While it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters, such costs could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, liquidity, or results of operations of Whirlpool     F-19    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    The Brazilian Constitution provides a general basis for recognizing tax credits on the purchase of raw materials used in  production (“IPI tax credit”)  Certain raw materials that are exempt or have a zero tax basis in the production process qualify for these IPI tax credits  Based on legal precedent, in 2003 and 2004, we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of $26 million adjusted for currency  The Brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of IPI tax credits  No credits were recognized in 2005 through 2009  In 2009, we entered into an agreement under a special Brazilian government program providing for extended payment terms and reductions in penalties and interest to encourage taxpayers to resolve disputed IPI tax credit amounts  Charges recorded related to this program for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $27 million in tax that was recorded in cost of products sold, $16 million in interest expense and $4 million in penalties recorded in interest and sundry income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income  During the December 2009 quarter, based on newly issued regulations, we settled with the Brazilian tax authority to resolve these and other disputed tax amounts  As a result of this settlement agreement, we recorded an increase in value added taxes owed of approximately $4 million in cost of goods sold, a reduction in interest expense totaling $18 million related to interest abatement, a reduction in interest and sundry income (expense) of $4 million related to penalty abatement and related income tax expense of $5 million under this special program   In 1989, a Brazilian affiliate (now a subsidiary) brought an action against a financial institution in Brazil seeking a “Declaration of Non-Enforceability of Obligations” relating to loan documentation entered into without authority by a senior officer of the affiliate  In September 2000, an adverse decision in the declaratory action became final  In 2001, the financial institution began a collection action and we responded with a counterclaim  The lower court dismissed the counterclaim in 2002 and the Superior Court confirmed the lower court decision in December 2005  The Superior Court dismissed our counterclaim in 2007  In late 2008, the lower court issued a decision in the collection action in favor of the financial institution in the amount of 283 million Brazilian reais (approximately $162 million), plus judicial adjustments, which could be significant  We have appealed this decision  Based on our outside counsel’s assessment of the case, we increased the amount previously accrued for our estimated exposure for this litigation by 80 million Brazilian reais (approximately $46 million) in the December 2009 quarter  However, the amount of the final award, if any, may be materially different than the amount we have accrued   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf  Certain statements contained in this annual report, including those within the forward-looking perspective section within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf do not relate strictly to

“forward-looking statements” which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events  Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “possible,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “forecast,” and similar words or expressions  Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies, financial results, product development, and sales efforts  These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions  Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially   This document contains forward-looking statements about Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Whirlpool”) that speak only as of this date  Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements  Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and material and oil-related prices  Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool’s forward-looking    F-20    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—(CONTINUED)    statements  Among these factors are:   changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the building industry and the level of interest rates;   the effects of the global economic crisis on our customers, suppliers and the availability of credit;   Whirlpool’s ability to continue its relationship with significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share;   intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers;   the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency fluctuations;   product liability and product recall costs;   litigation and legal compliance risk;   the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, cost control, leveraging of its global operating platform, and acceleration of the rate of innovation;   inventory and other asset risk; (10) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (11) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (12) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post retirement benefit plans; (13) Whirlpool’s ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (14) information technology system failures and data security breaches; (15) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool’s significant geographic regions, including uncertainty and disruptions arising from natural disasters or terrorist attacks; (16) the effects of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; (17) the impact of labor relations; (18) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (19) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental and health and safety regulations   We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results  Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements  Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report     F-21    WHIRLPOOL

STATEMENTS    SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  General Information  Whirlpool Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances  We manufacture appliances in 12 countries under 13 principal brand names in four geographic operating segments and market products in nearly every country around the world  Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation   We have evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was February 17, 2010   Use of Estimates  We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates   Revenue Recognition  Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer as determined by the shipping terms  For the majority of our sales, title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped  For a portion of our sales, title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customer’s location  Allowances for estimated returns are made on sales of certain products based on historical return rates for the products involved   Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  We carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts  We periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and the history of write-offs and collections  We evaluate items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable write-offs  Our policy is to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due  A receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within agreed upon invoice terms   Freight and Warehousing Costs  We classify freight and warehousing costs within cost of products sold within our Consolidated Statements of Income   Cash and Equivalents  All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents   Inventories  Inventories are stated at first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost, except U S  production inventories, which are stated at last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost, and Brazil and Asia inventories, which are stated at average cost  Costs do not exceed realizable values  See Note 4 for additional information about inventories     F-26    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Goodwill and Other Intangibles  Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis (or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment)  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level  The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its discounted cash flows  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded  In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets)  The difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill   In assessing the fair value of trademarks, we utilize a relief from royalty method  If the carrying amount of a trademark exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess  Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate key assumptions involved in valuing our trademarks, including projected revenues, royalty rates and applicable discount rates   Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life ranging from 6 to 18 years  See Note 2 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets   Accounts Payable Outsourcing  We offer our suppliers access to a payables presentment and settlement service (PPS) provided by a third party processor  This service allows our suppliers to view scheduled Whirlpool payments online, enabling them to better manage their cash flow and reduce payment processing costs  Independent of Whirlpool, the PPS provider also allows suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution  We have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct relationship with financial institutions concerning this service  All of our obligations, including amounts due, remain to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $246 million and $119 million, respectively, of our total accounts payable is available for this purpose and approximately $145 million and $72 million, respectively, has been sold by suppliers to participating financial institutions   Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $455 million, $436 million and $421 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively   Advertising Costs  Advertising costs are charged to expense when the advertisement is first communicated and totaled $211 million, $336 million and $321 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively   Discontinued Operations  We present the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of operations that have either been sold or that meet the “held for sale accounting” and certain other criteria as discontinued operations     F-27    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currency for our international subsidiaries and affiliates is typically the local currency  Certain international subsidiaries primarily utilize the U S  dollar and Euro as the functional currency   Long-Lived Assets  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost  During the March 2009 quarter, we changed our method of depreciation prospectively for substantially all long-lived production machinery and equipment to a modified units of production depreciation method  Under this method, we record depreciation based on units produced, unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method  Prior to 2009, all machinery and equipment was depreciated using the straight-line method  We believe depreciating machinery and equipment based on units of production is a preferable method as it best matches the usage of assets with the revenues derived from those assets  For nonproduction long-lived assets, we depreciate costs based on the straight-line method  Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $497 million, $569 million and $562 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively   The estimated useful lives for major asset classifications are as follows:    Asset Classification    Estimated Useful Life  Buildings   25 to 50 years Machinery and equipment   4 to 23 years Computer/Software   1 to 8 years  As a result of this change in method, and lower overall production levels in 2009, depreciation expense decreased by $83 million from what would have been recorded using the straight-line method  Net of amounts capitalized into ending inventories and income taxes, net earnings increased $48 million for 2009, or $ 64 per diluted share   We classify gains and losses associated with asset dispositions in the same line item as the underlying depreciation of the disposed asset in the Consolidated Statements of Income  Net gains and losses recognized in cost of products sold include a loss of $3 million for 2009 and gains of $16 million and $51 million for 2008, and 2007, respectively  Net gains recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses include $1 million, $19 million and $14 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively   We record impairment losses on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts   Derivative Financial Instruments  We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges to manage our exposure to the volatility in material costs, foreign currency and interest rates on certain debt instruments  We fair value these derivative instruments periodically  Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i e , gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated  For those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, we designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation  Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current earnings  See Note 7 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments     F-28    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Income Taxes  In accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year that the differences are expected to reverse  Judgment is required in determining and evaluating our income tax provisions  We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position  We evaluate and adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  For additional information about income taxes, see Note 11   Stock Based Compensation  We recognize stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period)  The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected option life and dividend yield  Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the stock price on the date of grant  The fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units is based on the closing market price of Whirlpool common stock on the grant date  See Note 9 for additional information about stock based compensation   BEFIEX Credits  Our Brazilian operations earned tax credits under the Brazilian government’s export incentive program  These credits reduce Brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales, resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales  Based on a recalculation of available credits and a favorable court decision in the fourth quarter of 2005, we were able to recognize approximately $69 million, $168 million and $131 million of export credits during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively  As of December 31, 2009, approximately $693 million of export credits remain  We recognize credits as they are monetized; however, future actions by the Brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits  See Note 11 for additional information about how these credits impact our effective tax rate which are included in “Foreign government tax incentive” in the rate reconciliation of our effective tax rate   Reclassifications  We reclassified certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Financial Statements to be consistent with current period presentation  The effect of these reclassifications is not material   New Accounting Standards  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No  168, “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”)  ASC 105 establishes the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U S  GAAP  The standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on September 30, 2009, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 810, “Consolidation”, regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities (formerly SFAS No  167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No  46 ”)  ASC 810 is intended to improve financial reporting by providing additional guidance to companies    F-29    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   involved with variable interest entities and by requiring additional disclosures about a company’s involvement in variable interest entities  This standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after November 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing” (formerly SFAS No  166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets”)  ASC 860 requires more information about transfers of financial assets and where companies have continuing exposure to the risk related to transferred financial assets  It eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosure  This standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after November 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of the standard on January 1, 2010, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements   In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (formerly FASB Staff Position 107-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”)  ASC 825 requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies, as well as in annual financial statements  This standard also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009  We adopted the provisions of ASC 825 on June 30, 2009  See Notes 3 and 5 for information related to the fair value of our financial instruments   In March 2008, the FASB issued the disclosure requirements within ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (formerly SFAS No  161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB No  133”)  ASC 815 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows  The disclosure requirements apply to all derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815  The standard also applies to non-derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying under ASC 815  We adopted the disclosure requirements of ASC 815 on January 1, 2009  For additional information regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 7   In December 2007, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (formerly SFAS No  141 , “Business Combinations”)  ASC 805 requires us to continue to follow the guidance in SFAS 141 for certain aspects of business combinations, with additional guidance provided defining the acquirer, the accounting for transaction costs and contingent consideration, recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, assets and liabilities arising from contingencies, defining a bargain purchase and recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase  In addition, adjustments associated with changes in tax contingencies that occur after the measurement period, not to exceed one year, are recorded as adjustments to income  This statement was effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008; however, the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of income tax contingencies is retrospective to business combinations completed prior to January 1, 2009  We adopted ASC 805 on January 1, 2009   In December 2007, the FASB issued accounting guidance contained within ASC 810, “Consolidation”, regarding noncontrolling interests (formerly SFAS No  160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”)  ASC 810-10-65 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary  It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements  We adopted ASC 810-10-65 on January 1, 2009  As a result, we have reclassified financial statement line items within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income for the prior period to conform with this standard  Additionally, see Note 8 for disclosure reflecting the impact of ASC 810-10-65 on our reconciliation of comprehensive income and stockholders’ equity     F-30    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  Goodwill  Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of each year, by reporting unit  We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows  Our reporting units include: North America, Europe, Multibras and Embraco (which combined is our Latin America reportable operating segment) and Asia  We performed the annual impairment tests and determined there is no impairment for any period presented   The following table summarizes the net carrying amount of goodwill:    Reporting unit—Millions of dollars   December 31,   2009   2008  North America   $1,724  $1,724 Embraco    5   4          Total   $1,729  $1,728         Other Intangible Assets  The following table summarizes our net carrying

value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy is established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions   Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques  The three valuation techniques are identified in the table below and are as follows:      (a)  Market approach—prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or  comparable assets or liabilities    F-31    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    (b)  Cost approach—amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost)      (c)  Income approach—techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations  (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models)  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:    December 31—Millions of dollars   Total     Quoted Prices In Active Markets for  Identical Assets (Level 1)     Significant Other Observable Inputs  (Level 2)     Significant Unobservable Inputs  (Level 3)    Valuation Technique   2009          Money market funds   $ 355   $ 355  $ —   $ —  (a)  Net

investments    17    17   —    —  (a)        Money market funds are primarily comprised of U S  government obligations   During 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $9 million in our Europe segment associated with an available for sale investment  The impairment charge was recorded in interest and sundry income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2008     INVENTORIES    December 31—Millions of dollars   2009   2008   Finished products   $1,853   $2,213   Work in process    50    49   Raw materials    439    515          2,342    2,777   Less excess of FIFO cost over LIFO cost    (145)   (186)      Total inventories   $2,197   $2,591      The decrease in inventories in 2009 compared to 2008 is driven primarily by increased demand in our Latin America region due to favorable economic conditions in Brazil, the Impostos sobre Produtos sales tax holiday declared by the Brazilian government for the second half of 2009 and decreases in production levels in our North America and Europe regions   LIFO inventories represent approximately 40% and 43% of total inventories at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively  Throughout 2009, we decreased our excess of FIFO cost over LIFO cost reserve due to the impact of lower materials costs during 2009 and decrements in LIFO layers totaling approximately $2 million     F-32       NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)     FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  Debt  The following table summarizes our debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008:   Millions of dollars

31, 2009:    Millions of dollars     2010   $ 378 2011    312 2012    361 2013    511 2014    611 Thereafter    707     Total debt   $2,880    On May 4, 2009, we completed a debt offering comprised of   $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8 000% notes due May 1, 2012 and   $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8 600% notes due May 1, 2014  The proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes  If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, the notes are subject to an increase in the interest rate, resulting in higher interest payments  The notes contain customary covenants that limit our ability to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions  In addition, if we experience a specific kind of change of control, we are required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest  The notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No  333-157392) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2009   On February 28, 2008 we completed the issuance of $500 million 5 50% notes due March 1, 2013  The notes were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  We pay interest semiannually on March 1 and September 1  The notes contain a provision which requires Whirlpool to make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if certain change of control events occur  The notes are also subject to customary non-financial covenants     F-33    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    During 2009, we have incurred and paid a total of $5 3 million in debt financing related fees  These amounts have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the respective agreements   We are in compliance with debt covenant requirements at December 31, 2009   The fair value of long-term debt (including current maturities) at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,060 million and $2,037 million, respectively, and was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements   Notes Payable  Notes payable consist of short-term borrowings payable to banks  The fair value of our notes payable approximates the carrying amount due to the short maturity of these obligations  The weighted-average interest rate on notes payable was 4 3% and 3 8% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively   We have credit facilities which provide $1 35 billion maturing on August 13, 2012 and $522 million maturing December 1, 2010, and include a $200 million letter of credit subfacility  Borrowings under the credit facilities are available to us and designated subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support  Subsidiary borrowings under these facilities, if any, are guaranteed by us  Interest under the credit facilities accrues at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin  The margin is dependent on our credit rating at that time  The credit facilities require us to meet certain leverage and interest coverage requirements  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, borrowings of $0 and $247 million, respectively, were outstanding under these credit agreements and are included within notes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets  We are in compliance with financial covenant requirements at December 31, 2009 and 2008   On February 27, 2009, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Long-Term Five- Year Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated as of December 1, 2005, by and among Whirlpool Corporation, certain other borrowers, the lenders referred to therein, Citibank N A , as administrative agent and fronting agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N A , as syndication agent, and ABN Amro Bank N V , Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America, as documentation agents   The First Amendment amends our $2 2 billion Credit Agreement to   increase our maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 3 5 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, reverting to 3 0 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter;   reduce our minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 1 5 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2009, reverting to 2 0 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter;   limit the value of the assets subject to non-permitted liens to an amount equal to $200 million and permit liens on assets located outside of the United States arising by operation of law;   exclude an amount of non-recurring cash restructuring charges of up to $100 million on a rolling 12 month basis for the purposes of calculating “Consolidated EBIT” and “Consolidated EBITDA” under the Credit Agreement;   for purposes of calculating the “Leverage Ratio,” provide for a $200 million exclusion from the definition of “Indebtedness” for net assets or liabilities with respect to hedging contracts;   increase the spread over LIBOR to 3%, the spread over prime to 2%, and the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed $1 1 billion, to 1% as of the date of the First Amendment; and   replace the facility fee with an unused commitment fee of 0 50%, as of the date of the First Amendment   On August 13, 2009, we entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which Whirlpool Corporation amended and restated such facility to be an Amended and Restated Long-Term Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), by and among Whirlpool Corporation, certain other borrowers, the lenders referred to therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N A , as Administrative Agent and Fronting Agent, Citibank, N A , as Syndication Agent, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Fortis Capital Corp  and Bank of America, N A , as Documentation Agents     F-34    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    The Second Amendment divides and reduces the existing credit facility into a $1 35 billion tranche maturing on August 13, 2012 (the “Extending Tranche”) and a $522 million tranche maturing December 1, 2010 (the “Non-Extending Tranche”)  The Second Amendment also increases the letter of credit sublimit from $100 million to $200 million  The interest rate margin over LIBOR and the prime rate will be charged based on Whirlpool’s credit rating   For the Extending Tranche, the Second Amendment provides that the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed 50% of the facility, is 0 50%  For the Non-Extending Tranche, the Second Amendment provides that the utilization fee to be paid, if amounts borrowed exceed 50% of the facility, is 1%  We will incur a commitment fee for any unused portion of the credit facility which is based on Whirlpool’s credit rating   The Second Amendment requires us to meet certain financial tests  Whirlpool’s maximum rolling twelve month Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) is limited to 3 5 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2010, and 3 25 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter  The rolling twelve month Interest Coverage Ratio (as redefined in the Amended Credit Agreement as EBITDA to Interest Expense) is required to be greater than or equal to 2 5 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended on or prior to December 31, 2010 and 3 0 to 1 0 for each fiscal quarter ended thereafter   During 2009, we have incurred and paid a total of $32 8 million in notes payable financing related fees  These amounts have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the respective agreements     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Guarantees  We have guarantee arrangements in a Brazilian subsidiary  As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies  If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank, and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the guaranteed amounts totaled $309 million and $203 million, respectively  Our only recourse with respect to these arrangements would be legal or administrative collection efforts directed against the customer   We provide guarantees of indebtedness and lines of credit for various consolidated subsidiaries  The maximum amount of credit facilities available under these lines for consolidated subsidiaries totaled $1 4 billion and $1 3 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively  Our total outstanding bank indebtedness under guarantees totaled $18 million and $364 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively   As of May 16, 2008, we guaranteed a $50 million five year revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a not-for-profit entity in connection with a community and economic development project (“Harbor Shores”)  The fair value of the guarantee is nominal  The purpose of Harbor Shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of Benton Harbor and St  Joseph, Michigan  In the event of default, we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default   Warranty Reserves  Product warranty reserves are established in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized  The amounts of those reserves are based on established terms and our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date     F-35    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    The following represents a reconciliation of the changes in product

Commitments  At December 31, 2009, we had noncancelable operating lease commitments totaling $897 million  The annual future minimum lease payments are summarized by year in the table below:    Millions of dollars     2010   $186 2011    159 2012    126 2013    99 2014    79 Thereafter    248      Total noncancelable operating lease commitments   $897     Our rent expense was $208 million,

STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Legal Contingencies  Government authorities in various jurisdictions are conducting antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry, including our compressor business headquartered in Brazil (“Embraco”)  In 2009, Embraco sales represented approximately 7% of our global net sales   In February 2009, competition authorities in Brazil, the U S  and Europe began to seek documents from us in connection with their investigations  A grand jury subpoena from the U S  Department of Justice requested documents for the time period from 2003 to 2009  Competition authorities in other jurisdictions have sought similar information   In September 2009, the Brazilian competition commission (CADE) agreed to terminate the administrative investigation of our compressor business  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Whirlpool affiliates and certain executives located in Brazil acknowledged a violation of Brazilian antitrust law in the Brazilian compressor market by some Embraco employees  The settlement agreement provides for the affiliates to make contributions totaling 100 million Brazilian reais to a Brazilian government fund  The contributions translate to approximately $56 million, all of which was recorded as an expense in 2009  In December 2009, a Brazilian court agreed to the public prosecutor’s request to suspend a related criminal proceeding as to certain employees, including Paulo Periquito, former President, Whirlpool International  The proceeding will be dismissed after three years provided that the individuals comply with certain conditions imposed by the court, such as payment to a government fund, a charitable donation and periodic reporting to authorities  Suspension and dismissal of the proceeding does not involve any admission or finding of wrongdoing  We are cooperating with the ongoing government investigations in other jurisdictions and have taken actions, and will continue to take actions, to minimize our potential exposure   Since the government investigations became public in February 2009, we have been named as a defendant in numerous related antitrust lawsuits in various jurisdictions seeking damages in connection with the pricing of compressors from 1996 to 2009  Several other compressor manufacturers who are the subject of the government investigations have also been named as defendants in the litigation  United States federal lawsuits instituted on behalf of purported purchasers and containing class action allegations have been combined in one proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan  We intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously   The final outcome and impact of these matters, and related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables, and cannot be predicted with certainty  An accrual has been established only where we have determined that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  As of December 31, 2009, we have accrued charges of approximately $82 million related to these matters  While it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters, such costs could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, liquidity, or results of operations of Whirlpool   The Brazilian Constitution provides a general basis for recognizing tax credits on the purchase of raw materials used in production (“IPI tax credit”)  Certain raw materials that are exempt or have a zero tax basis in the production process qualify for these IPI tax credits  Based on legal precedent, in 2003 and 2004, we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of $26 million adjusted for currency  The Brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of IPI tax credits  No credits were recognized in 2005 through 2009  In 2009, we entered into an agreement under a special Brazilian government program providing for extended payment terms and reductions in penalties and interest to encourage taxpayers to resolve disputed IPI tax credit amounts  Charges recorded related to this program for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $27 million in tax that was recorded in cost of products sold, $16 million in interest expense and $4 million in penalties    F-37    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   recorded in interest and sundry income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income  During the December 2009 quarter, based on newly issued regulations, we settled with the Brazilian tax authority to resolve these and other disputed tax amounts  As a result of this settlement agreement, we recorded an increase in value added taxes owed of approximately $4 million in cost of goods sold, a reduction in interest expense totaling $18 million related to interest abatement, a reduction in interest and sundry income (expense) of $4 million related to penalty abatement and related income tax expense of $5 million under this special program   In 1989, a Brazilian affiliate (now a subsidiary) brought an action against a financial institution in Brazil seeking a “Declaration of Non-Enforceability of Obligations” relating to loan documentation entered into without authority by a senior officer of the affiliate  In September 2000, an adverse decision in the declaratory action became final  In 2001, the financial institution began a collection action and we responded with a counterclaim  The lower court dismissed the counterclaim in 2002 and the Superior Court confirmed the lower court decision in December 2005  The Superior Court dismissed our counterclaim in 2007  In late 2008, the lower court issued a decision in the collection action in favor of the financial institution in the amount of 283 million Brazilian reais (approximately $162 million), plus judicial adjustments, which could be significant  We have appealed this decision  Based on our outside counsel’s assessment of the case, we increased the amount previously accrued for our estimated exposure for this litigation by 80 million Brazilian reais (approximately $46 million) in the December 2009 quarter  However, the amount of the final award, if any, may be materially different than the amount we have accrued   We are currently defending a number of class action suits in federal and state courts alleging breach of warranty, fraud and violation of state consumer protection acts  There are no allegations of any personal injury or property damage  However, unspecified compensatory damages are being sought  We believe these suits are without merit  We intend to vigorously defend these actions   We are involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business  Management, after taking into consideration legal counsel’s evaluation of such actions, is of the opinion that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements   Product Recalls  We regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to customers  We are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues  As necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted   On March 10, 2009, we announced, in a joint press release issued with the U S  Product Safety Commission, a voluntary recall of 1 8 million refrigerators sold in the U S  and Canada between 2001 and 2004  The recall is due to a defect in an electrical relay component purchased from a supplier  The estimate of the affected population is higher by 0 8 million refrigerators than as disclosed in our 2008 Form 10-K due to a determination that the defective part which caused the product recall also resulted in similar failures in another type of refrigerator  There have been no other significant changes in assumptions other than increasing the affected population  As a result, we have accrued $67 million as the estimated cost of this recall  We have recorded $35 million and $32 million, respectively, as a charge to cost of products sold related to this accrual during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008  Our actual costs related to this action will depend on several factors, including the number of consumers who respond to the recall, the costs of repair and administration, and whether costs will be recovered from the supplier  Of this accrual, we have approximately $2 million remaining at December 31, 2009   On February 1, 2007, Maytag Corporation announced a voluntary recall of approximately 2 3 million Maytag and Jenn-Air brand dishwashers  We originally estimated the cost of the recall to be $82 million, which we recorded as an assumed liability in our purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Maytag, with a    F-38    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   corresponding increase to recorded goodwill  As of September 30, 2008, we had revised this estimate to $102 million due to an anticipated increase in the response rate  The incremental increase of $20 million was charged to cost of products sold in our Consolidated Statement of Income during 2008  Of this $102 million accrual, we had approximately $7 million remaining at December 31, 2008, all of which was paid during 2009     HEDGES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument  For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item  For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings  The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings  Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings   Using derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk  Counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract  We deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties  We do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties  The amount of counterparty credit exposure is the unrealized gains, if any, on such derivative contracts  We do not require, nor do we post, collateral or security on such contracts   Hedging Strategy  We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations  As a result, we enter into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business  The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and domestic and foreign interest rate risks  Fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition  We manage the exposure to these market risks through operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments  We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes   Foreign currency exchange rate risk  We incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries, while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries  Our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from cross-currency sales of products  As a result, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencies   We enter into certain undesignated non-functional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to short-term payables, receivables, inventory and intercompany loans  These forecasted cross-currency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements, royalty agreements and dividends   Commodity price risk  We enter into forward contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process  The objective of the hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of those commodities     F-39    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Interest rate risk  We enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure  Our interest rate swap agreements effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk, primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense  These agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts, respectively, over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts   The following table summarizes our outstanding derivative contracts and their effects on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009:              Fair Value of

and other assets or other current liabilities and other liabilities  As of December 31, 2009, hedge assets of $119 million and $40 million were recorded in other current assets and other assets, respectively, and hedge liabilities of $61 million and $1 million were recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively         Designated derivatives are either considered cash flow (CF) or fair value hedges (FV)   The effects of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009 are as follows:    Cash Flow

contracts maturing, and expected to be realized during the next twelve months is a gain of $57 million at December 31, 2009   Early Hedge Settlement  During November and December 2008, we cash settled certain foreign currency derivative contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates  As a result of these transactions, we received $82 million in cash, which represented the fair value of these contracts at the date of settlement  Effective gains of $82 million were initially recorded in accumulated OCI until the hedged forecasted transactions affected earnings, then the gains were recorded as a reduction in cost of products sold on our Consolidated Statements of Income  Approximately $10 million of these gains were recorded in earnings during 2008 and the remainder was recorded in earnings in 2009  There was no ineffectiveness related to these settled foreign currency derivative contracts     STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income primarily includes   our reported net earnings,   foreign currency translation,   changes in the effective portion of our open derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges,   changes in our unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits and   changes in fair value of our available for sale securities     F-41            NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    The following table

net earnings per share of common stock include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based compensation plans  For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, a total of approximately 3,090,508 options, 2,728,410 options and 1,709,000 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive     F-42    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were calculated as follows:   December

1 8% of the outstanding noncontrolling interest in Brasmotor S A  for $12 million  This transaction closed on January 15, 2010 and raised our ownership interest in Brasmotor S A  to 95 6%   Repurchase Program  In June 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million  During 2007, we repurchased 3 8 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $368 million and during the March 2008 quarter, we repurchased 1 1 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $97 million under this program  At March 31, 2008, there were no remaining funds authorized under this program   On April 23, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million  Share repurchases are made from time to time on the open market as conditions warrant  During 2008, we repurchased 1 9 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $150 million under this program  We made no share repurchases during 2009  At December 31, 2009, there were $350 million remaining funds authorized under this program   Preferred Stock Purchase Rights  Rights to repurchase preferred stock under the Rights Agreement dated April 12, 1998 expired on May 22, 2008 pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement     STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS  We sponsor several share-based employee incentive plans  Share-based compensation expense for grants awarded under these plans was $27 million, $30 million and $40 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $10 million, $11 million and $15 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively   At December 31, 2009, unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option and stock unit awards totaled $33 million  The cost of these non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 34 months   Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans  On April 17, 2007, our shareholders approved the 2007 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (“2007 OSIP”)  This plan was previously adopted by our Board of Directors on February 20, 2007 and provides for the issuance    F-43    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   of stock options, performance stock units, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units with terms of no more than 10 years  At December 31, 2009, approximately 630 thousand shares remain available for issuance under the 2007 OSIP, our only active plan   Stock Options  Eligible employees receive stock options as a portion of their total compensation  Such options generally become exercisable over a three-year period, expire 10 years from the date of grant and are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment  We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees  Granted options have exercise prices equal to the market price of Whirlpool common stock on the grant date  The principal assumptions utilized in valuing options include:   risk-free interest rate—an estimate based on the yield of U S  zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option;   expected volatility—an estimate based on the historical volatility of Whirlpool common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option; and   expected option life—an estimate based on historical experience  Based on the results of the model, the weighted-average fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $6 42, $21 03 and $22 54, respectively, using the following assumptions:   Weighted Average Black-Scholes Assumptions   2009   2008   2007   Risk-free interest rate   1 9%  3 0%  4 7%  Expected

receive restricted stock units or performance stock units as a portion of their total compensation   Restricted stock units are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and vest over three years  Periodically, restricted stock units may be granted to selected executives based on special recognition or retention circumstances and generally vest from three years to seven years  Some of these awards accrue dividend equivalents on outstanding units (in the form of additional stock units) based on dividends declared on Whirlpool common stock  These awards convert to unrestricted common stock at the conclusion of the vesting period   Performance stock units are granted to executives on an annual basis  The final award may equal 0 – 200% of a target based on pre-established Whirlpool financial performance measures related to the current year  The awards vest two years following the end of the performance period and convert to unrestricted common stock at the conclusion of the vesting period   We measure compensation cost for stock units based on the closing market price of Whirlpool common stock at the grant date  The weighted average grant date fair values of awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $26 51, $55 83 and $96 81, respectively   The following table summarizes stock unit activity during the year ended

Director Equity Plan provides for   a one time grant of 1,000 shares of common stock made at the time a director first joins the Board;   an annual grant of stock options, with the number of options to be determined by dividing $36,000 by the product of the fair market value of a single share of our common stock on the final trading day before the annual meeting of stockholders multiplied by 0 35; and   an annual grant of stock, with the number of shares to be issued to the director determined by dividing $54,000 by the average fair market value of a single share of our common stock for the final three trading days before the grant  The exercise price under each option granted is the fair market value of the common stock on the last trading day before the annual meeting of stockholders   (10) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  Under our ongoing global operating platform initiatives, we implemented certain restructuring initiatives to strengthen our leadership position in the global appliance industry  We plan to continue a comprehensive worldwide effort to optimize our regional manufacturing facilities, supply base, product platforms and technology resources to support our global brands and customers  We incurred total restructuring charges of $126 million, $149 million, $61 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 respectively  These charges are included in restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income and primarily consist of    F-45    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   charges to restructure the cooking platform in Latin America, shift refrigeration and dishwasher capacity within Europe and North America, shift cooking capacity within North America, restructure the laundry platforms in North America, Europe and Asia and reorganize the salaried workforce throughout North America and Europe   On October 27, 2008, management committed to a workforce reduction plan to reduce our employee base worldwide beginning during the fourth quarter of 2008 through the beginning of 2010  We expect to incur approximately $100 million in employee termination costs, $14 million in asset impairment costs and $3 million in other associated costs for a total of $117 million that will be incurred as a result of this workforce reduction  We incurred charges of $39 million in 2009 and $64 million in 2008 associated with this workforce reduction, which are included in the $126 million and $149 million, respectively, in total restructuring charges discussed above  As of December 31, 2009, approximately $15 million of these workforce reduction costs remain, all of which will result in future cash expenditures   Our 2008 restructuring initiatives are reducing our overall workforce by approximately 5,000 employees and contractors worldwide through the beginning of 2010  We expect to incur additional costs of $14 million in our Europe region and $1 million in our North American region through the beginning of 2010 related to these initiatives  For additional information about restructuring charges by business segment, see Note 13   On August 28, 2009, we announced changes to our North America manufacturing operations which will result in the closure of our manufacturing facility in Evansville, Indiana in mid-2010  We currently expect that approximately 1,100 full-time positions will be eliminated as a result of the closure  We estimate that we will incur approximately $50 million in total costs in connection with the exit of this facility comprised of $20 million in employee termination costs, $13 million in equipment relocation costs, $5 million in asset impairment costs, and $12 million in other associated costs  During 2009 we incurred $20 million associated with this announcement, $14 million of which is included in the $126 million in total restructuring charges discussed above  We expect to recognize approximately $27 million of these costs in the 2010 fiscal year, $2 million of these costs in the 2011 fiscal year and estimate that approximately $31 million of the estimated $50 million in total cost will result in future cash expenditures  As of December 31, 2009, approximately $30 million of these closure costs remain, all of which will result in future cash expenditures   A summary of our restructuring liability balance and full year restructuring

 2,275    2,212       Net deferred tax assets   $1,180   $1,049         At December 31, 2009, we have net operating loss carryforwards of $2,689 million, $1,063 million of which are U S  state net operating loss carryforwards  Of the total net operating loss carryforwards, $751 million do not expire, with substantially all of the remaining carryforwards expiring in various years through 2029  As of December 31, 2009, we had $47 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards and $317 million of U S  general business credit carryforwards available to offset future payments of federal income taxes, expiring between 2016 and 2029   We routinely review the future realization of deferred tax assets based on projected future reversal of taxable temporary differences, available tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income  We have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the net estimated amount of certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and other deferred tax assets we believe will be realized  Our recorded valuation allowance of $180 million at December 31, 2009 consists of $149 million of net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets and $31 million of other deferred tax assets  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances mentioned above     F-48    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    We have historically reinvested all unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates  We plan to distribute approximately $139 million of foreign earnings over the next several years  This distribution is forecasted to result in tax benefits which have not been recorded because of their contingent nature  There has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of $2 4 billion at December 31, 2009  Should we make a distribution out of the $2 4 billion of unremitted earnings, we would be subject to additional U S  taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings   On October 3, 2008, The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “Act”) was signed into law  The Act includes a wide-range of provisions that are intended to ensure that conservation and efficiency are a central component to the United States energy strategy  Among the many provisions of this legislation are manufacturers’ tax credits for the accelerated U S  production of super-efficient clothes washers, refrigerators and dishwashers that meet or exceed certain Energy Star thresholds for energy and water conservation levels as set by the U S  Department of Energy (“Energy Credit”)  The tax credits apply to eligible production during the 2008 to 2010 calendar years provided the production of qualifying product in any individual year exceeds a rolling two year baseline of production  We have historically, and will continue to, invest over 2% of our annual sales in research and development to provide innovative and energy efficient products that meet these standards for our customers  As a result, during 2008 and 2009 and in 2010 we expect to record a tax credit benefit under the provisions of the Act related to the production of qualifying appliances  Including the Energy Credit, total general business tax credits recorded during 2009 reduced our effective tax rate by 42 5%   We are in various stages of audits by certain governmental tax authorities  We establish liabilities for the difference between tax return provisions and the benefits recognized in our financial statements  Such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known   We adopted ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (formerly FIN 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB 109” (“FIN 48”)) on January 1, 2007, at which time the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefit on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $166 million  Upon adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a $2 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a $2 million decrease in federal benefit related to state uncertain tax positions  The increase was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the amount of $8 million and a reduction to goodwill in the amount of $4 million  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:    Millions of dollars       2009          2008      Balance, January 1   $ 119   $ 189   Additions for tax positions of the current year    47    4   Additions for tax positions of prior years    15    2   Reductions for tax positions of prior years for:      Changes in

liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are $163 and $119 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, net of $15 million and $16 million, respectively, of federal benefits related to state uncertain tax positions     F-49    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    We recognize charges related to interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense  As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have accrued interest and penalties of $26 and $25 million, respectively  Interest and penalties are not included in the tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits above   Included in additions for tax positions of the current year are $13 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to our September 30, 2009 settlement with the Brazilian competition commission  For additional information see Note 6   We file income tax returns in the U S  federal, various state, local and foreign jurisdictions  We are no longer subject to any significant U S  federal, state, local or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006  The Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our U S  income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 in the fourth quarter of 2008 that is anticipated to be completed during early 2011  It is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits of $12 million could be settled with the related jurisdictions during the next 12 months   (12) PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLANS  We have funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our North American employees and certain European, Asian and Brazilian employees  The formula for U S  salaried employees covered under the qualified defined benefit plan sponsored by Whirlpool was based on years of service and final average salary, while the formula for U S  hourly employees covered under the defined benefit plans sponsored by Whirlpool was based on specific dollar amounts for each year of service  There were multiple formulas for employees covered under the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans sponsored by Maytag, including a cash balance formula  The U S  plans are frozen for the majority of participants  A defined contribution plan is being provided to all U S  employees subsequent to the pension plan freezes and is not classified within the net periodic benefit cost  In addition, we sponsor an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan  This plan is nonqualified and provides certain key employees defined pension benefits that supplement those provided by the company’s other retirement plans   The U S  qualified defined benefit pension plans provide that in the event of a plan termination within five years (36 months for the defined benefit plan sponsored by Maytag) following a change in control of Whirlpool, any assets held by the plans in excess of the amounts needed to fund accrued benefits would be used to provide additional benefits to plan participants  A change in control generally means either a change in the majority of the incumbent Board of Directors or an acquisition of 25% (30% for purposes of the Whirlpool Production Employees Retirement Plans and 20% for purposes of the defined benefit plan sponsored by Maytag) or more of the voting power of Whirlpool’s outstanding stock   We provide postretirement health care benefits for eligible retired U S  employees  Eligible retirees include those who were full- time employees with 10 years of service who attained age 55 while in service with us and those union retirees who met the eligibility requirements of their collective bargaining agreements  In general, the postretirement health care plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually and generally include cost-sharing provisions that limit our exposure for recent and future retirees  The plans are unfunded  We reserve the right to modify the benefits in the future  We provide no significant postretirement medical benefits to non-U S  employees   Amended Plans  During 2009, we modified retiree medical benefits for certain retirees as part of our effort to provide consistent benefits to all U S  employees  These modifications resulted in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $113 million with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive income, net of tax     F-50    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)    On August 28, 2009, we announced the closure of our manufacturing facility in Evansville, Indiana in mid-2010  The announcement triggered a curtailment within our pension plan for Evansville hourly employees, resulting in a one-time curtailment loss of $6 6 million included in net periodic cost with an offset to other comprehensive income, net of tax  During the September 2009 quarter, we recorded the entire loss in our Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of cost of products sold   On June 16, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the option for the company to use up to $100 million of company stock to fund the U S  pension plans  If we elect to partially fund the U S  pension plans in company stock, contributions may be made on a periodic basis from treasury stock, or, with the prior approval of the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, from authorized, but unissued shares  As of December 31, 2009, we have not used company stock to fund our U S  pension plans   On February 9, 2009, we announced the suspension of the annual credit to retiree health savings accounts for the majority of active participants  The result of the indefinite suspension was a one-time curtailment gain of $89 million included in net periodic cost with an offset to other comprehensive income, net of tax  During the March 2009 quarter, we recorded $80 million of this gain in our Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of cost of products sold and $9 million was recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses   On August 1, 2008, certain retiree medical benefits for the retirees and remaining active participants associated with our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility were amended (Newton Amendment), effective January 1, 2009, to be consistent with those benefits provided by the Whirlpool Corporation Group Benefit Plan  The result of this amendment was a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation of $229 million with a corresponding increase to other comprehensive income, net of tax   In conjunction with the Newton Amendment, we initiated legal proceedings with certain retirees and the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America to seek a declaratory judgment that Whirlpool has the right to change retiree medical benefits after July 31, 2008, the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement  In response, a similar group of retirees has initiated legal proceedings against Whirlpool asserting the above benefits are vested  We believe the outcome of the legal proceedings against Whirlpool will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements   The U S  heritage Whirlpool and Maytag pension plans were amended to cease benefit accruals for the majority of salaried and non-union participants effective December 31, 2006  For heritage Whirlpool salaried employees who are eligible to retire before January 1, 2010, the plan freeze was effective December 31, 2009  An enhanced defined contribution plan is being provided to affected employees subsequent to the plan freeze   401(k) Defined Contribution Plan  During the March 2009 quarter we announced the suspension of company matching contributions for our 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all U S  employees  We also announced that our automatic company contributions equal to 3% of employees’ eligible pay will be contributed in company stock  Our contributions amounted to the following amounts:   Millions of dollars   2009  2008  2007 401 (k) Company contributions   $40  $70  $68  During the December 2009 quarter we announced the reinstatement of company matching contributions for our 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all U S  employees, effective March 2010     F-51    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   Obligations and Funded Status at End of Year    Millions of dollars   U S  Pension

related to the conversion of our Mexico defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan  Additionally, we recognized a curtailment gain of $17 million in our U S  postretirement health care plan as a result of the reduction in force announced on October 27, 2008  See Note 10 for additional information regarding our restructuring initiatives   During 2007, we recognized curtailment losses of

historical asset returns for publicly traded equity and fixed income securities tracked from 1927 through 2009 and the historical returns for private equity  The historical equity returns were adjusted downward to reflect future expectations  This adjustment was based on published academic research  The expected returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations  The resulting weighted-average return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent   For foreign pension plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by observing historical returns in the local fixed income and equity markets and computing the weighted average returns with the weights being the asset allocation of each plan   Estimated impact of one percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rate  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans  A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:    Millions of dollars    One Percentage Point Increase     One Percentage Point Decrease    Effect on total of service and interest cost   $ 3  $    Effect on postretirement benefit obligations    35   (31)   Cash Flows  Funding Policy  Our funding policy is to contribute to our U S  pension plans amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement as defined by employee benefit and tax laws, plus additional amounts which we may determine to be appropriate  In certain countries other than the U S , the funding of pension plans is not common practice  We have several unfunded non-U S  pension plans  We pay for retiree medical benefits as they are incurred   Expected Employer Contributions to Funded Plans    Millions of dollars    U

strategy is to achieve an appropriate mix of investments for long-term growth and for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and investment fund managers  The target allocation for plan assets is generally 60% equity and 40% fixed income, with exceptions for certain foreign pension plans  Of the target allocation for equity securities, approximately 50% is allocated to U S  large-cap, 30% to international equity, 13% to U S  mid and small-cap companies and 7% in venture capital)  The target allocation for fixed income is allocated evenly with 50% to corporate bonds and 50% to U S  treasury and other government securities  The fixed income securities duration is intended to match that of our U S  pension liabilities   The fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2009, by asset category are as follows:    Asset Category—Millions of dollars    December 31, 2009     Quoted prices  (Level 1)     Other significant

is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance   We identify such segments based upon geographical regions of operations because each operating segment manufactures home appliances and related components, but serves strategically different markets  The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based upon each segment’s operating income, which is defined as income before interest and sundry income (expense), interest expense, income taxes, minority interests and restructuring costs  Total assets by segment are those assets directly associated with the respective operating activities  The “Other/Eliminations” column primarily includes corporate expenses, assets and eliminations, as well as all other restructuring and discontinued operations  Intersegment sales are eliminated within each region with the exception of compressor sales out of Latin America, which are included in Other/Eliminations   Sales activity with Sears, a North American major home appliance retailer, represented 10%, 11% and 12% of consolidated net sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively  Related receivables were 11% and 13% of consolidated trade receivables as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively   We conduct business in two countries that individually comprised over 10% of consolidated net sales and/or total assets within the last three years  The United States represented 48%, 48%, 53% of net sales for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, while Brazil totaled 15%, 13%, 12% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively  As a percentage of total assets, the United States accounted for 53%, and 51% at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively  Brazil accounted for 12% and 10% of total assets at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively   As described above, our chief operating decision maker reviews each operating segment’s performance based upon operating income which excludes restructuring costs  These restructuring costs are included in operating profit on a consolidated basis and included in the Other/Eliminations column in the tables below  For 2009, the operating segments recorded total restructuring costs (See Note 10) as follows: North America—$35 million, Europe—$74 million, Latin America—$5 million, Asia—$10 million and Corporate—$2 million, for a total of $126 million  For 2008, the operating segments recorded total restructuring costs as follows: North    F-57    NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)   America—$56 million, Europe—$78 million, Latin America—$7 million, Asia—$2 million and Corporate—$6 million for a total of $149 million  For 2007, the operating segments recorded total restructuring costs as follows: North America—$13 million, Europe— $28 million, Latin America—$20 million, for a total of $61 million   As disclosed in Note 1, during the March 2009 quarter, we changed our method of depreciation prospectively for substantially all long-lived production machinery and equipment to a modified units of production depreciation method  Under this method, we record depreciation based on units produced, unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is then recorded using the straight-line method  Prior to 2009, all machinery and equipment was depreciated using the straight-line method  We believe depreciating machinery and equipment based on units of production is a preferable method as it best matches the usage of assets with the revenues derived from those assets  As a result, our depreciation expense by operating segment decreased for 2009 as follows: North America—$46 million, Europe—$25 million Latin America—$11 million and Asia—$1 million, for a total of $83 million  Net of amounts capitalized into ending inventories, operating profit increased for 2009 as follows: North America—$41 million, Europe—$19 million, Latin America—$11 million and Asia—$1, for a total of $72 million     Millions of dollars    OPERATING SEGMENTS     North  America   Europe    Latin  America  Asia

Officer February 17, 2010    F-61    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The management of Whirlpool Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Whirlpool’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Whirlpool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements   All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation   The management of Whirlpool assessed the effectiveness of Whirlpool’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework  Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that Whirlpool maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009   Whirlpool’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on its assessment of Whirlpool’s internal control over financial reporting  This report appears on page F-64     /s/    JEFF M  FETTIG          /s/    ROY W  TEMPLIN

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Stockholders and Board of Directors Whirlpool Corporation Benton Harbor, Michigan  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whirlpool Corporation at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U S  generally accepted accounting principles  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein   As described in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new rules regarding the accounting for noncontrolling interests  As described in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2009, the Company changed its method of depreciation for machinery and equipment from straight-line to modified units of production  As described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new rules regarding the accounting for income tax uncertainties   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Whirlpool Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon   /s/    ERNST & YOUNG LLP Chicago, Illinois February 17, 2010    F-63    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Stockholders and Board of Directors Whirlpool Corporation Benton Harbor, Michigan  We have audited Whirlpool Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria)  Whirlpool Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion   A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   In our opinion, Whirlpool Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009,
